# LivePage-md

### a real-time web page generator

LivePage-md take pre-existing links to markdown documents and renders them into 
full attractive web pages, complete with a generated table of contents, a modal 
window with links to important sections, and a second modal window with links to
other documents. 

LivePage-md is a single url that takes the url of a markdown document as a query 
string parameter. Therefore, url's to any permalink markdown document already 
exist for LivePage-md without any setup. Since LivePage-md renders the page in 
real-time, update to pages are done instantly when ever the original markdown 
file is modified.

This makes deployment and editing take zero effort.
